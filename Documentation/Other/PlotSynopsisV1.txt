You play as Lance Phenes.

An escapee mental patient on the rampage throughout Dallas, Texas all the way down to New Orleans. Lance was committed to Armstrong Sanitarium at the age of fifteen for butchering his entire family all because he "felt like it."

You play as fifteen year old Lance in the first mission and butcher your family before being arrested (in a cutscene).

Eighteen years pass and the legend of Lance Penes still lives strong in his home town of Klanson Lane (work in progress name), just outside of New Orleans.

One night, a storm arrives and knocks out all the power to the Asylum. Your objective -- Escape by ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

Guided by the voices in his head, Lance (you) must murder and sneak your way out of the asylum and make your way back home, thousands of miles away, killing all you feel worthy, and those who stand in your way...

General idea - you must kill your way back home. Lance's goal is to return back home where it all began, clearly still insane. However along his journey he must kill innocents to stop the voices in his head from "hurting" him inside. This can lend itself to some cool gameplay mechanics.

You go from house to house, town to town, city to city wreacking havock on those who wish to be happy. All just to get home and return to where you belong.
