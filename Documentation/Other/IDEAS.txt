COLE:

A QTE sequence where when you approach a door -- you can try prying it open with a tool or brute strength -- spamming an input to wedge at the door, however if you are heard, people will come to investigate so be cautious using this option of entry. Best used for a less stealth approach -- also increases your victims fear meter.
